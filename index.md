# Nektar Alcohol Database 

The Nektar alcohol database is a free open access database of 730 images (679 alcohol-related images and 51 neutral images). All images were taken from open and free-to-use photo websites (creative commons license) and were chosen to cover a widespread variety of alcohol-associated images (e.g. images are divided by alcohol type e.g. wine, beer spirits, and then further subdivided based on context e.g. sooical, food, pouring, branding etc.)- All images have been rated, tested, and validated by 324 alcohol drinkers who each rated a subsample of the dataset based on their preferred type of alcohol. These ratings demonstrate that the Nektar Alcohol Database images cover a wide range of intensities along the stimulus dimensions of “craving” and “valence”. Thus, the Nektar Alcohol Database images are suited particularly well to investigate cue-induced behavior and neural activity over a large continuum of intensities.

This page provides access to:

## Further Details

The Nektar Alcohol Database is a curated image database of alcohol-related and neutral cues with ratings of **valence** and **craving**.  
The dataset contains **730 images** across the following main categories:

```
beer              (n = 205)  
wine              (n = 192)  
spirits           (n = 195)  
general_alcohol   (n = 87)  
neutral           (n = 51)  
```
Alcohol images were also qualitatively assigned to the following distinct content categories:  
```
social_setting          (n = 131)  
pouring                 (n = 79)  
holiday_setting         (n = 60)  
negative_context        (n = 60)
